# Alpha Testing Guide

## Installing the apps

### iOS

### Android

## Using the app

Once the app is installed on your device and you start it up, you'll be presented with a login page. All you need to so is enter you name and your public and private keys will be generated for you. These will be stored on your device and will be used to make votes. _Note: at this stage, your keys can NOT be transferred to another device._

You can browse both the Bills and Issues tabs, navigate to the voting section and make votes. You vote will be updated into the results within 10 minutes
